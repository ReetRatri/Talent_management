        <h2>Approach
        </h2>
      </div> -->
      <p><b>Work out math problems.</b> Solving math problems is one of the most common ways of improving analytical skills.</p>
      <p>Math is very logical and math problems are structured in a way that we are given information and are forced to use that information to solve a problem.</p>
      <p>As a result, math problems are one of the simplest ways of honing analytical ability.</p>
        <ul class="accord_ul for_color ">
                <li>Practice complicated math problems that include long division, algebra, calculus, and more. These problems will help you develop your logic and reasoning skills and as a result improve your analytical ability.</li>
                <li>Identify math problems in everyday life, then take time to solve them.</li>
                 <li>Enroll in a college level math course. Many college level math courses will help you cultivate your analytical skills.</li>


        </ul>
        <p><b>Consider conducting a simple Root Cause Analysis (RCA).</b> The root cause analysis definition revolves around the process of identifying the source of a problem and looking for a solution in a way that the problem is treated at the root level.
        </p>
        <p><b>Here are 5 steps to take to conduct this analysis:</b></p>
        <ul class="for_color">
          <li>Realize the problem.</li>
          <li>Gather data.</li>
          <li>Determine possible causal factors.</li>
          <li>Identify the root cause.</li>
          <li>Recommend and implement solutions.</li>
        </ul>


     </div>

          </div>
        </div>
     <div class="col-12">
<p>As you look for root cause analysis techniques and root cause analysis examples, start by exploring these most commonly used ones and see if these are appropriate for the situation you’re aiming to address.
</p>
<p>The simplest approach to RCA is the 5 whys. This method employs only one step, being repeated over and over again. All you need to do is start with a problem statement and then ask “Why?” 5 times, with each “Why?” leading you closer to the root cause.
</p>
<p><b>Here is an example of root cause analysis using The 5 Whys?</b></p>
<ul class="for_color">
  <li>Problem statement: The electric water heater suddenly stopped working.</li>
  <li>Why did it stop? It was found that the circuit breaker was tripped.</li>
  <li>Why did the circuit breaker trip? The electric water heater was about to overheat.
  </li>
  <li>Why was the electric water heater about to overheat? A buildup of sediment was found around the heating elements.
  </li>
  <li>Why was the machine not checked and cleaned? There was a missed inspection and maintenance routine.
  </li>
  <li>Why was there a missed routine check? The assigned team member wasn’t properly informed about the schedule.
  </li>
</ul>
<p><b>Play brain games.</b> One of the best ways to improve your analytical skills is to engage them directly by playing “brain games.”</p>
<p>Brain games are games that challenge you to think deeply and to develop your analytical skills. These games will get you used to thinking in a certain way and as a result, they will help improve your ability to think.</p>
<p>Ultimately, brain games are a fun way to actively develop your analytical skills while having fun.</p>
<ul class="for_color">
  <li>One example of a brain game are logic puzzles. Logic puzzles vary and include crossword, riddles, Sudoku, and more. Logic puzzles are available on the internet or at a bookstore near you.</li>
  <li>Play board games. Many board games require you to use your analytical skills and to develop them further. Perhaps the best of these are games like scrabble, some strategy games, and games like chess or checkers.</li>
  <li>Find video games that encourage the development of your analytical skills. A wide array of video games help to improve analytical skills. Some of the best, though, are strategy games and other games that challenge us to solve problems and achieve broad goals.
  </li>

      <p><b>Build a large knowledge base.</b> One of the most important things in developing your analytical skills is also creating a strong knowledge base for yourself.</p>
      <p>The more you learn, and the more you know about the world, the more tools and information you’ll have when it comes to understanding and solving problems.</p>
      <p><b>To enlarge your knowledge base, consider</b></p>
      <ul class="accord_ul for_color ">
        <li>Reading extensively. Don’t just focus on one subject or genre.</li>
        <li>Subscribing to newspapers or informational magazines like National Geographic to learn more about the world around you.</li>
            <li>Attending lectures and academic talks and conferences.</li>
            <li>Going back to college or finding free educational classes in your community.</li>

        </ul>

      <p><b>Take time to think about things.</b> Take all the time you need to think and reflect about an array of things. In fact, make it a point to think about things instead of making quick and rash decisions.
      </p>
      <p>Thinking about things and considering a variety of factors will help hone your problem solving and analytical skills.
      </p>
      <ul class="accord_ul for_color">
        <li>Use any opportunity you have to think things over and to examine different scenarios.
        </li>
        <li>Consider multiple sides of a problem before picking a solution.</li>
        <li>Avoid picking the easiest and simplest solution right away. However, don't rule out the easiest solution, as it might be worthwhile.
        </li>
      </ul>





    </div>

  </div>
</div>

<div class="col-12">
<p><b>Expand your worldview.</b> One of the best ways to improve your analytical skills is to expand your worldview. This is no quick fix though.</p>
<p>Expanding your worldview takes time. Ultimately, it will help you better evaluate information and to analyze different ideas and outcomes.</p>

  <ul class="accord_ul for_color">
    <li>Try to think about different ways of viewing the world. Do this by trying to step outside of your religious, political, and cultural suppositions about truth.</li>

        <li>Try to understand and even work to defend positions and ideas you would normally dismiss. You can do this by taking important political positions and working to rationalize and defend the opposite viewpoint that you accept.
        </li>
        <li>Meet with and surround yourself with people who are very different from yourself. Finding people who have different backgrounds and ideas than you will help you understand and accept ideas different than those you are familiar with.
        </li>


  </ul>
  <p><b>Search for connections.</b> Ultimately, many things in our daily lives are connected.</p>
  <p>Whether it be the migration of birds and other animals and the seasons, or car emissions and changing whether patterns, things are connected. By discovering connections, you'll help hone your analytical skills.
  </p>
  <p>For instance, go on a hike and think about connections between the animals, plants, weather patterns, and water and food sources.</p>

  <ul class="accord_ul for_color ">
    <li>Think about things in terms of cause and effect. Consider the repercussions of a prolonged drought. What is the impact of the drought? Look beyond the obvious.
    </li>

  <li>Think about the similarities between things. How are all living things the same? What similar things do both humans and spiders need to exist?</li>
  <li>Think about connections in history. What cycles, patterns, or other common trends do we see? For instance, in American history, consider how periods of reform are often ended by conflict (the Progressive Era and World War One, the New Deal and World War Two, the Great Society and the Vietnam War).</li>
</ul>
<p><b>Pay attention to detail.</b> Attention to detail is extremely important in analytical skills.</p>
<p>Without knowing the ins and the outs of a problem, or knowing the specifics, you'll be less likely to craft a successful and workable solution. </p>
<p>Make sure to look at small things (as well as large things).</p>

<P><b>Ask yourself questions about why things are the way they are.</b> Contemplating the natural order of things is an extremely helpful way to hone your observation and analytical skills.</P>
<p>By thinking about why things are the way they are, you'll develop a better understanding of the world and you'll challenge yourself to think about complex issues.
</p>

  <ul class="accord_ul for_color ">
    <li>Never take the easy answer. Always keep questioning.</li>

        <li>If you see a dog, observe what it's doing. Ask yourself why it is doing that. Even if it is a simple action. If it is running to fetch a ball or stick, is it doing this for fun? What about hunting instincts? Is it showing loyalty to its owner by doing that? Is the dog looking motivated, or lazy? Why might it be motivated or lazy?
        </li>

        <li>Try to solve complex problems without aid. Instead of using a calculator to compute a math problem, do it in your head or on paper.</li>
